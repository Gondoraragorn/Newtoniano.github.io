        Over the past several years, I've been part of several projects as a mentor, not as a student.
        So, even though I did not work on these in the building part, I still gave a lot of advice and helped the students with it.
        This is a list of some of them:

                The aim of this project was to build a glove which could play music. They built a glove with buttons at the fingertips where each played a specific note.

            # 2023 MIT&CIC Hacakthon Light Saber
    
            During the 2023 Hackathon, I heard about a group of high schoolers who wanted to build a light saber, so I went to check out what they where up to
            and I immediately wanted to help these students as they shared great passion for this idea. This team was formed by people from different ages and schools,
            so they didn't know each other at the beginning.

            I started talking to them about what their ideas were and soon I realized they had no experience with Arduinos, nor soldering, nor sawing. Anything.
            So I took it upon myself to teach them these skills and mentor them on how they would like to build it.

            After two intense days of soldering, coding and 3D Printing they where able to build a working prototype of a light saber.
            It had an animation when it was turned on and off and used an opaque cylinder to cover the LEDs inside.

            After the hackathon, this was one of its major projects and it has been mentioned in several interviews to the organizers (<a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline !important;" href="https://educa.barcelona/2023/02/09/alicia-lopez-la-hackato-dona-llibertat-a-lalumne-per-fer-el-projecte-que-vulgui/">Alicia Lopez at educa.barcelona</a> and <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline !important;" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/22/1076988/edgerton-center-instructor-takes-mens-et-manus-mindset-on-the-road/">Edward Moriarty at MIT Technology Review</a>)

            # 2023 CIC TechProjects
    
            As part of the 2023 Hackathon, we where invited to mentor the students at the high school CIC Baxtillerats, where we helped solving problems of several projects and bring some new ideas into them.
            These are the highlights of some of these projects:
            
            ## LED Ball
            They where planning on building a ball with touch sensors, an Accelerometer and Gyroscope, and LED Strips.
            They wanted to change the colors depending on the velocity and if someone's touching it, it shouldn't light up. With the possibility of adding some delay between the throwing and receiving of the ball.
            Some issues we addressed with them where:
            - How to power such a small device wirelessly.
                - To what we found the solution of using a powerbank to give nominal 5V power to the arduino nano.
            - How to fit those touch sensors and use them.
                - We found some other sensors that might do a better job or placing five of them in the best way possible.

            ## Vinyl / Record Player
            This project consisted in repairing and rebuilding an old broken Record player and they wanted to tune it to be able to change speed.

            During the time we spent with them we talked about:
            
            - Trying to reverse engineer the amplifier board that they got with the record player
                - To what we encountered that either there was something broke in the PCB or we were lacking some other piece to plug the connector into.
            - We opened to the idea of finding a way to play the records without electronical components, so using a mechanical way (like the paper speaker they built.
                - Now they are considering moving into the mechanical way, but it has to be talked between the whole group, as during today two people where missing.
            - The needle that they are using is damaging the records, so Ed suggested to buy some Record player's needles from a company.
            
            ## Electric Scooter
            Another group was working on building an electric scooter from scratch. They already had scooter built out of wood and now they wanted to add the electrical part.
            I did not get the opportunity to mentor this group that much, but I gave them advice on the building.
