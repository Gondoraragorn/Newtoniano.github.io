Even though the results were not great, we did have a good competition where we were able to keep pushing and delivering in tasks even though we had some crazy complications, including short circuits and battery issues.

                    I got to take part as a Mentor in the MIT Edgerton Center Engineering Design Workshop 2024! An amazing program where High Schools students from all around the world get to build in groups something they're passionate about. Even though I helped with all the groups in some way, I spent most of the time with Furrari! A group that wanted to build a car for a cat, where the car would go wherever the cat was facing. They designed and built a small version of a car out of foam and sculpted it into a ferrari and together with some coding and electronics, it worked!

Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning incorporating them into my own Python programs.

                    The MIT Engineering Design Workshop 2022 was a month long EDW where people from around the world came together to build, design and prototype ideas at the Edgerton Center at MIT.
                    During this month long stay we got to do different fun activites related to engineering and to get to know each other, like building and launching Water Rockets, using a High Speed camera to take photos of ourselves popping water ballons.
                    The project that we built for that EDW was a foot piano, that had nine notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, F#, G) and that could be arranged in any way to play any song we wanted.
                    Our group consisted of Three Americans (Hrushi, Harri, Archim), two italians (Emilia & Clara) and two Spaniards (Oriol and me), so to overcome our language barriers also became a fun challenge.

                    During the 2021 Hackathon organized by Fundació CIC and The MIT Edgerton Center, we built and tested a robotic hand which could be moved from the other side of the word.
                    This project, called Shaking Hands Overseas was started during this Hackathon by Marti Vinyolas, Eduard Lleget and myself and took a little over 6 months to get it working.
                    During this hackathon we 3D printed and tested our first and second of three prototypes that we would eventually build.

                    The 2020 Hackathon organized by Fundació CIC and The MIT Edgerton Center consisted on the building, prototyping and testing of our own ROV (Remote Operated Vehicle).
                    From the design to the wiring, we designed and built our own with help and advice from mentors from MIT, who where students at the time.
